# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Description
- In my work day scheduler, I have made the date and time available at the top of the page. Users should be able to see a real time countdown of the page. They should also be able to see a 9-5 work day schedule in which they can add anything they have planned in a specific time slot. That data should them be stored in the local storage and should be available when they refresh and exit and re-enter the page. 

## My Process
- First, I tackled getting the time to show up on the page using Moment.js.
- Next, I added the time slots in the HTML along with the textareas and buttons. 
- Then, I attempted to tackle changing the color of the time slots based on whether they were in the past, present, or future.
- I, then, added it into the local storage so that it will be saved and remain on the page even if the page is refreshed.
Lastly, I was able to style the page to my liking. I went for an angry boos theme

- In the future, I will add places for the local Storage to be stored on screen screen. They will also have a remove button so that they can be removed when they are no longer needed.

## Obstacles
- I had a tough time foguring out how to do the local storage.
